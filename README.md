## Introduction

This project aims to forecast the prices of various metals using historical price data. The forecasting model is built using a Bidirectional LSTM neural network, which is well-suited for time series prediction tasks. The repository also includes a Tkinter-based GUI application that allows calculating price of a metal based on its content in a waste or mineral. Prices can be found in the attached excel file. Price are varying, and highly dependent on the metal form and purity. 

## Features

- **Metal Price Forecasting**: Forecast the prices of various metals using historical price data.
- **Bidirectional LSTM Model**: Utilize a Bidirectional LSTM neural network for accurate forecasting.
- **Tkinter GUI**: A user-friendly GUI application for visualizing metal values and calculating the total metal value.
- **Data Visualization**: Plot the original and forecasted metal prices for better analysis.

## Installation
